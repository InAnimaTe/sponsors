## Sponsoring Orchestructure

While Orchestructure is made up of amazing attendees who provide ideas, insight,
and expertise, we still need awesome Sponsors to keep the group running smoothly.

Most of our expenses revolve around planning, meeting, online resources and other miscellaneous expenses. We accept Paypal, check, cash, or direct deposit.

We provide three distinct tiers for Sponsors to give. They are meant to be flexible
and fair to both the sponsors and meeting attendees. In addition, we
also have other options for smaller organizations or individuals who want
to give to Orchestructure. If for some reason, you'd like to contribute but don't
see a fitting option here, feel free to open an issue!
